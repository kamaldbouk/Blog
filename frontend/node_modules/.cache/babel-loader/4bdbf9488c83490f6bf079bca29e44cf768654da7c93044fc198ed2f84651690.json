With limited space, it may seem challenging to grow a thriving garden, but with creativity and the right approach, you can create a lush green sanctuary in the heart of the city. Here are some hidden gems and tips to help you get started: 1. Rooftop Gardens If you have access to a rooftop, it can be an excellent place to start your urban garden. Rooftop gardens can accommodate a variety of plants, from vegetables to flowers. Ensure you have the right containers, quality soil, and a good irrigation system. Consider growing hardy plants like succulents, herbs, and small fruit trees. 2. Balcony Gardening Balconies are another fantastic option for urban gardening. You can use pots, hanging baskets, and vertical planters to maximize space. Plants like cherry tomatoes, peppers, and herbs are perfect for balcony gardens. Make sure your plants receive enough sunlight and are protected from strong winds. 3. Indoor Gardening For those with no outdoor space, indoor gardening is the way to go. Use windowsills, shelves, and even walls to place your plants. Choose low-maintenance plants like pothos, snake plants, and ZZ plants. These plants not only add greenery but also help purify the air. 4. Community Gardens Join a community garden if you have limited space at home. These gardens provide a plot where you can grow your plants while also connecting with fellow gardeners. Community gardens often offer workshops and shared resources to help you succeed. 5. Vertical Gardens Maximize your space by growing plants vertically. Use trellises, wall-mounted planters, or create a green wall with modular systems. Vertical gardening is ideal for growing herbs, leafy greens, and even strawberries.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 23,\n        columnNumber: 13\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 22,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n      className: \"comment-section\",\n      children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n        className: \"comment-header\",\n        children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h3\", {\n          children: \"Comment Section\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 38,\n          columnNumber: 17\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n          className: \"vote-section\",\n          children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n            className: \"vote-button upvote\",\n            onClick: upvote\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 40,\n            columnNumber: 21\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n            className: \"vote-count\",\n            children: \"0\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 41,\n            columnNumber: 21\n          }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n            className: \"vote-button downvote\",\n            onClick: downvote\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 42,\n            columnNumber: 21\n          }, this)]\n        }, void 0, true, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 39,\n          columnNumber: 17\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 37,\n        columnNumber: 13\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n        className: \"comment-input-container\",\n        children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"img\", {\n          src: icon,\n          alt: \"icon\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 46,\n          columnNumber: 17\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"input\", {\n          type: \"text\",\n          className: \"comment-here\",\n          placeholder: \"Add a comment...\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 47,\n          columnNumber: 17\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"button\", {\n          className: \"post-comment\",\n          children: \"Post\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 48,\n          columnNumber: 17\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 45,\n        columnNumber: 13\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n        className: \"other-comments\",\n        children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"img\", {\n          src: icon,\n          alt: \"icon\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 51,\n          columnNumber: 17\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"span\", {\n          children: \"DISPLAY COMMENTS HERE\"\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 52,\n          columnNumber: 17\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 50,\n        columnNumber: 13\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 36,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 15,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }, this);\n};\n_c = BlogView;\nexport default BlogView;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"BlogView\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["blogPic","icon","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","BlogView","upvote","downvote","className","children","src","alt","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","onClick","type","placeholder","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["/Users/kamaldbouk/Desktop/blog/frontend/src/components/BlogView.js"],"sourcesContent":["import blogPic from '../pages/img/blog.jpg'\nimport icon from '../pages/img/icon.jpg';\n\nconst BlogView = () => {\n\n    const upvote = () => {\n        \n    }\n\n    const downvote = () => {\n        \n    }\n    \n    return (\n        <div className=\"blog-container\">\n        <div className='blog-header'>\n            <img src={blogPic} alt='Blog Header'/>\n            <h1>TITLE HERE</h1>\n            <h3>Published by: AUTHOR HERE <span className=\"secondary-text\">13th of January 2024</span></h3> \n            <h4>DESCRIPTION HERE: Discover the beauty and benefits of urban gardening in this insightful blog.
